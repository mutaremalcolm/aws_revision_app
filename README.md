### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

---

As I prepared for my AWS Certification Exams, I searched for a tool that could assist me in studying effectively. However, I found that most available tools lacked critical features or werenâ€™t tailored to the needs of someone preparing for these exams. This realization motivated me to create the AWS Revision Guideâ€”a focused, questionnaire-based tool designed to help candidates achieve success in their AWS Certification journey.

The AWS Revision Guide offers an intuitive way to review concepts, answer questions, and track progress. Itâ€™s an ideal companion for anyone pursuing AWS certifications.

I build the quiz app using NextJS to leverage its speed by making use of SSR, i opted for tailwind for produce a slick minimal, and fully responsive UI. I also enjoyed working with framer motion to enhance the user experience by incorpoarting visually appealling transformations.

The project is still under project and based on user feedback, i have defined a roadmap that is set out in the Project Kanab with the link above, but just in passing i will add  more quizes for the AWS badges, and also convert the application to a PWA. I also plan to migrate the application to AWS (seems natural and fitting) its currently deployed on Vercel.
